                <span>I started as a software engineer. But soon realized it wasn't 
                    the place for me. I love code, but I didn't love coding as my job; it
                    is more of a hobby. After college, I found myself working for Deloitte
                    in the cyber practice focused on data privacy. To my surprise, it is the 
                    perfect balance of technical and strategic. Yet, I find myself lacking a creative
                    outlet. That's where this website comes in.

                <span>If I had to describe my brain in three words... open, goofy, 
                    minimalistic (in a good way, I think haha)

                <span>I recently started writing as a way to finesse my craft and crystallize 
                    my thinking. I don't write about one topic, but rather whatever is on my 
                    mind at the time.

                    I'm a cybersecurity consultant with a knack for solving complex problems
                    and getting the job done. That's how I ended up in my current gig, Deloitte 
                    Cyber where I've been for the past 4 years.

                    <!-- My background consists of a computer science degree with a visual communications
                    minor. I started as a software engineer, but soon realized it wasn't 
                    the place for me. I love to code, but I don't love coding as my job; it's
                    more of a hobby. -->
                    <br><br>
                    I started out in privacy compliance,
                    working with a big tech company maturing an enterprise wide privacy programs to comply 
                    with external regulators and supporting a regulatory audit. 
                    <br><br>
                    Next, I pivoted to 
                    application security, leading a team that performed the operations of a data protection
                    assessment program inside a company's DevOps function. I enjoy supporting my team by
                    providing subject matter expertise on information security topics and helping individuals grow.

                <h4 class="sub-desc-titles">Thoughts on Technology & Design</h4>
                <span> 
                    So you already know I'm a consultant by day and a computer programmer 
                    by trade, but I'd also say I'm a designer by passion. I mean I did design this 
                    entire website.
                    <br><br>
                    As a computer science graduate with a minor in visual communication, 
                    I am interested in the intersection between technology and design.
                    <br><br>
                    The weaving of modern tech with digital design is a relatively new concept.
                    Considering everyday
                    people weren't able to create and digitally design themselves using a computer until 
                    around the 1980s. This is when programming languages
                    took off, popularizing design tools, browsers, and software languages such as Adobe, Google Chrome, 
                    Microsoft Internet Explorer, and C++.
                    <br><br>
                    And interdependence between tech and design is seen even more
                    in the past couple years in unique jobs 
                    popping up in mainstream culture. Jobs such as, data visualizer, product designer,
                    blockchain smart contract creator, and
                    VR designer to name a few of my favorites. These two are inevitably connected and will
                    continue to be.
                    <br><br>
                    And in my mind, what connects these two? Most often technology is 
                    created to solve a unique problem for a group of users. The success of the technology solution is 
                    likely dependent on the design. The design needs to address the users needs in form and function.
                    We can't have useful technology without design, and more specifically human-centered design.

                    of hobbies. 
                    <br><br>
                    You name it, I've probably tried it or something similar. To name a few 
                    &mdash; slacklining, rollerblading, biking, hiking, ukulele, bass guitar,
                    baking, indoor skydiving, golfing, making my own coffee, knife throwing, rubix cubing,
                    and programming.

                    I'd consider myself a generalist who has an appetite for curious living.
                    I love travel, spending quality time with by girlfriend, Bob's Burgers, cycling,
                    and early bedtimes.

                    I care a lot about people, inclusion, and fairness. There really is room for everyone 
                    at the table. You just have to scoot over and pull up another chair. I value kindness, imagination, and 
                    making people smile.

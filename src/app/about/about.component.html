                <h2 class="description-titles">Where I was</h2><br>
                <span>I'm Anna Peterson. I grew up in a small town named LaCrescent, MN, and currently reside
                    in Minneapolis, MN. I started as a software engineer. But soon realized it wasn't 
                    the place for me. I love code, but I didn't love coding as my job; it
                    was more of a hobby. After college, I found myself working for Deloitte
                    in the cyber practice focused on data privacy. It's a great
                    balance between technical and stragetic work. Although, lately I find myself lacking 
                    a creative outlet. That's where this website comes in - a mix of 
                    designing and developing to feed my creative urge.

                <span>Data privacy consultant by day. Beer connoisseur by night. 
                    Computer programmer by trade. Designer by passion.

                <h4>Technlogy & Design</h4>
                <span> 
                    As a computer science graduate with a minor in visual communication, 
                    I am interested in the intersection between technology and design.
                    <br><br>
                    Design as been around for ages - think 38,000 BCE cave painting, but 
                    technology (at least modern technology such as the cellphone, computer, tv, and the cloud to 
                    name a few) has only been around since the late 1920s (invention of the tv). That is roughly 
                    100 years where these two intertwined. And even shorter if we count from when everyday
                    people were able to create and digitally design themselves using a computer around the 1980s when programming languages
                    took off, popularizing tools, browsers, and software languages such as Adobe, Google Chrome, 
                    Microsoft Internet Explorer, and C++. 
                    <br><br>
                    The weaving of modern tech with digital design is a relatively new concept. And it's seen even more
                    in the past couple years where jobs like data visializer, product designer,
                    blockchain smart contract creator, and
                    VR designer are popping up more in mainstream culture. Yet, as a new space these two continue to be 
                    inevitably connected. 
                    <br><br>
                    And in my mind, what connects these two? - problem solving. Most often technology is 
                    created to solve a unique problem of a user. The success of the technology solution is 
                    likely dependent on the design. The design needs to address the users needs in form and function.
                    We can't have useful technology without design & successful design without technology.

                <h4>Career</h4>
                <span>
                    Currently, I work in privacy compliance maturing enterprise wide privacy programs to comply 
                    with external regulators. 
                    <br><br>
                    Favorite parts about my job: 
                    <br>
                    1) articulating technical information
                    into an easy and digestible format - writing or speaking
                    <br>
                    2) braingstorming and strategizing actionable ways to enhance a program / project

                    Kindness is contagious. I'm here to spread love and equality. Help a friend & help a stranger.

                <span>
                    <b>Writing:</b> I started writing as a way to finesse my craft and crystallize 
                    my thinking. I don't write about one topic, but rather whatever is on my 
                    mind at the time.

                    My background consists of a computer science degree with a visual communications
                    minor. I started as a software engineer, but soon realized it wasn't 
                    the place for me. I love to code, but I didn't love coding as my job; it
                    was more of a hobby.
                    <br><br>
                    That's how I ended up in my next gig, Deloitte Cyber where I've been there the past 4 years.
                    I started out in privacy compliance,
                    working with a big tech company maturing an enterprise wide privacy programs to comply 
                    with external regulators and supporting a regulatory audit. Next, I pivoted to 
                    application security, leading a team that performed the operations of a data protection
                    assessment program inside the company's DevOps function.
                    <br><br>
                    Favorite parts about my job: 
                    <br>
                    1) articulating technical information
                    into an easy and digestible format
                    <br>
                    2) supporting my team by providing subject matter expertise on information security topic,
                    including vulnerability testing, patch management, encryption methods, orgnaization controls
                    such as data loss prevention, full disk encryption, etc., MFA, access controls, and much more.

                    You name it, I've probably tried it or something similar. To name a few

                <span> 
                    So you already know I'm a consultant by day and a computer programmer 
                    by trade, but I'd also say I'm a designer by passion. I mean I did design this 
                    entire website.
                    <br><br>
                    As a computer science graduate with a minor in visual communication, 
                    I am interested in the intersection between technology and design.
                    <br><br>
                    The weaving of modern tech with digital design is a relatively new concept.
                    Considering everyday
                    people weren't able to create and digitally design themselves using a computer until 
                    around the 1980s. This is when programming languages
                    took off, popularizing design tools, browsers, and software languages such as Adobe, Google Chrome, 
                    Microsoft Internet Explorer, and C++.
                    <br><br>
                    And interdependence between tech and design is seen even more
                    in the past couple years in unique jobs 
                    popping up in mainstream culture. Jobs such as, data visualizer, product designer,
                    blockchain smart contract creator, and
                    VR designer to name a few of my favorites. These two are inevitably connected and will
                    continue to be.
                    <br><br>
                    And in my mind, what connects these two? Most often technology is 
                    created to solve a unique problem for a group of users. The success of the technology solution is 
                    likely dependent on the design. The design needs to address the users needs in form and function.
                    We can't have useful technology without design, and more specifically human-centered design.

                    All I want to do is share my knowledge, explore new ideas, and build my craft. 
                    <br><br>
                    I'm doing that through writing. I want to share what I know

                    at the table. You just have to scoot over and pull up another chair. I value kindness, imagination, and 
                    making people smile.

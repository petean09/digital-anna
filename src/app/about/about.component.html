                <span>I'm Anna Peterson. I grew up in a small town named LaCrescent, MN, and currently reside
                    in Minneapolis, MN. I'm a computer science major and visual communications
                    minor. I started as a software engineer, but soon realized it wasn't 
                    the place for me. I love to code, but I didn't love coding as my job; it
                    was more of a hobby. After college, I found myself working for Deloitte
                    in the cyber practice focused on data privacy. Although, lately I find myself lacking 
                    a creative outlet. That's where this website came in - a mix of 
                    designing and developing to feed my creative urge.

                    1) articulating technical information
                    into an easy and digestible format - writing or speaking
                    <br>
                    2) braingstorming and strategizing actionable ways to enhance a program / project

                <span>For anyone who knows me personally, I am someone with an unfathomable odd number
                    of hobbies. You name it, I've probably tried it or something similar. To name a few 
                    &mdash; slacklining, rollerblading, biking, hiking, ukeleli, bass guitar,
                    baking, indoor skydiving, golfing, making my own coffee, knife throwing, rubix cubing,
                    and programming.

                <h4 class="sub-desc-titles">Thoughts on Technlogy & Design</h4>
                <span> 
                    As a computer science graduate with a minor in visual communication, 
                    I am interested in the intersection between technology and design.
                    <br><br>
                    The weaving of modern tech with digital design is a relatively new concept.
                    Considering everyday
                    people weren't able to create and digitally design themselves using a computer until 
                    around the 1980s. This is when programming languages
                    took off, popularizing design tools, browsers, and software languages such as Adobe, Google Chrome, 
                    Microsoft Internet Explorer, and C++.

                    And interdependence between tech and design is seen even more
                    in the past couple years in unique jobs 
                    popping up in mainstream culture. Jobs such as, data visializer, product designer,
                    blockchain smart contract creator, and
                    VR designer to name a few of my favorites. These two are inevitably connected and will
                    continue to be.
                    <br><br>
                    And in my mind, what connects these two? Most often technology is 
                    created to solve a unique problem for a group of users. The success of the technology solution is 
                    likely dependent on the design. The design needs to address the users needs in form and function.
                    We can't have useful technology without design, and more specifically human-centered design.

                <span>
                    I have a mission and goals, but other than that my life is still TBD.
                    I'd consider myself a generalist who has an appetite for living audaciously.

                <span>
                    I care a lot about people, inclusion, and fairness. There really is room for every one 
                    at the table. You just have to scoot over and pull up another chair. I value kindness, imagination, and 
                    making people smile.

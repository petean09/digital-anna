                    I'm a cybersecurity consultant with a knack for solving complex problems
                    and getting the job done. That's how I ended up in my current gig, Deloitte 
                    Cyber where I've been for the past 4 years.

                    <!-- My background consists of a computer science degree with a visual communications
                    minor. I started as a software engineer, but soon realized it wasn't 
                    the place for me. I love to code, but I don't love coding as my job; it's
                    more of a hobby. -->
                    <br><br>
                    I started out in privacy compliance,
                    working with a big tech company maturing an enterprise wide privacy programs to comply 
                    with external regulators and supporting a regulatory audit. 
                    <br><br>
                    Next, I pivoted to 
                    application security, leading a team that performed the operations of a data protection
                    assessment program inside a company's DevOps function. I enjoy supporting my team by
                    providing subject matter expertise on information security topics and helping individuals grow.

                    You name it, I've probably tried it or something similar. To name a few 
                    &mdash; slacklining, rollerblading, biking, hiking, ukulele, bass guitar,
                    baking, indoor skydiving, golfing, making my own coffee, knife throwing, rubix cubing,
                    and programming.

                    I'd consider myself a generalist who has an appetite for curious living.
                    I love travel, spending quality time with by girlfriend, Bob's Burgers, cycling,
                    and early bedtimes.

                    I care a lot about people, inclusion, and fairness. There really is room for everyone 
                    at the table. You just have to scoot over and pull up another chair. I value kindness, imagination, and 
                    making people smile.
